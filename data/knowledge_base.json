            "question": "What happens when a loan goes delinquent?",
            "answer": "When a loan goes delinquent, it means that the borrower has missed one or more scheduled payments. The lender typically contacts the borrower to discuss the missed payments and may offer options such as a repayment plan or loan modification. If the delinquency continues, the lender may initiate foreclosure proceedings to recover the outstanding debt by selling the property used as collateral for the loan."
